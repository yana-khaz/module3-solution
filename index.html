    <p>Baking chicken breasts in the oven is my second favorite way. You just need to make sure to use a thermometer so you don’t overcook the chicken, which is a common problem most people have. To begin, allow the chicken breast to sit at room temperature to remove the chill, but while it is doing that you can apply a flavorful spice rub.<br>Season the chicken breast with a shot of olive oil and a generous pinch of smoked paprika, cumin, salt, and a few cracks of pepper on both sides. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F, place the chicken breast on a tin foil lined sheet tray, and bake in the oven for 15-18 minutes. The key to not overcooking the chicken breast is to take its temperature using a digital probe thermometer that can stay in the oven during the cooking process. I highly recommend this one from Polder. I have two of them and use them all the time.<br>Stick the probe into the middle of the chicken breast after it’s been baking for 10 minutes, and once the internal temperature reaches 155 degrees F, pull the chicken from the oven and move it to a clean plate, leaving the thermometer inside.<br>Most chicken breast recipes call for cooking the chicken to 160 degrees F, which is the desired final temperature, but if you pull the chicken breasts from the oven at 155 degrees F, they will continue cooking and the temperature will rise at least another 5 degrees to 160 degrees F (known as carry-over cooking).  If you wait to pull the chicken from the over until it reaches 160 degrees F, the chicken breasts will be slightly overcooked.<br>Allow the chicken breasts to rest for 3-5 minutes after they come out of the oven and enjoy.</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Beef</h3>
    <p>Cook the perfect roast beef for Sunday lunch or a dinner party. We'll help you achieve tender, juicy meat whether you are cooking a rib, sirloin or fillet.<br><br>Beef fillet with slices<br><br>When it comes to roast beef, the received wisdom is that it should always be cooked on the bone – whether it's a sirloin joint or rib roast – as the bone both conducts heat and adds flavour. However, this doesn’t suit everyone and some of our most popular recipes are bone-free and much easier to carve. Buy what suits you best.<br>More important than the bone is the fat – don’t be tempted to trim it off as it will baste your meat while it cooks. You can always cut it away when you serve it. If you want the fat to make a crust, then you have to sprinkle or rub it with flour and/or mustard powder to absorb the fat released on the surface.<br>Generally roast beef is cooked at a high temperature to caramelise the outside, then the temperature is turned down. This method can also be reversed with a lower temperature to start before a blast of heat at the end. As an example, see our herb-scented slow-roasted recipe.<br>If you don’t have a meat thermometer then check your beef is roasted by piercing it with a skewer. The juices should run red for rare, pink for medium and clear for well-done. Also, a meat thermometer should read 40C for rare (it will rise to 54-56C, medium-rare, as it sits), 48C for medium (it will rise to 65C).<br>It is essential you rest your joint for at least an hour so the juices are re-absorbed. If you carve the beef too soon it will be dry rather than juicy. Some juices will be released as it sits and you can tip these into the gravy.<br><br>Rolled sirloin of beef in a tray of shallots<br><br>If cooking beef on the bone then a three-rib roast (about 3kg) will serve about seven to eight people. Calculate roughly 400g per person. If cooking beef off the bone, 1kg will serve four and 1½ kg will serve about six, so 200-300g per person. Calculate your cooking time for medium-rare with 20 mins per 500g, or for medium use 25 minutes per 500g.<br>For beef on or off the bone cook it at 240C/220C fan/gas 9 for 20 minutes, then turn down to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 (not forgetting to take this 20 minutes off the timing you have just calculated).</p>

    <p>How to Make Sushi Rolls<br>Today, we're making a variation on the California roll. Along with sushi rice and sheets of seaweed (nori), California rolls require only a few ingredients: crab meat (or imitation), avocado, and cucumber. If you like, mix the crab meat with a little mayo to create a creamy consistency.<br>To this basic list of ingredients, we've added sliced carrots and cooked shrimp...because that's how we (sushi) roll. Before we got further, a quick note on sushi rice. You can't use just any rice for sushi. Sushi rice is a special preparation of rice flavored with rice vinegar, sugar, and salt. It's made from short-grain rice (Japonica), typically made in Japan and parts of California and Italy. With homemade sushi rice, you're aiming for rice that's fluffy and a little sticky but not too sticky. Give it a try -- you'll get the hang of it. See how to make sushi rice.<br>Here's What You'll Need:<br>To make sushi at home, you'll need a few essential tools for making sushi:<br>Bamboo rolling mat (makisu)<br>Plastic wrap<br>Sharp knife<br>How to Make California Roll Sushi<br>This is the traditional way to roll any type of rolled sushi, which is called maki sushi. There are actually two options for this method: rolling with the sushi rice on top of the sheet of nori, as we do here; or with the nori flipped over so the rice ends up on the outside of the finished roll (uramaki sushi).<br>1. Place the bamboo rolling mat (you can get one for as little as $7 on Amazon) on a cutting board so the bamboo strips are running horizontally to you. Spread a strip of plastic wrap over the bamboo mat. Then place a sheet (or a half sheet) of nori on the plastic wrap.<br>Laying nori on plastic wrap on bamboo mat<br>Laying nori on plastic wrap on bamboo mat | Photo by Meredith2. Spread a thin layer of sushi rice over the nori. (See below for more about making perfect sushi rice.)<br>Don't use too much rice. With a little practice, you'll get a feel for how much rice to use. We're spreading about 1 cup of rice per whole sheet of nori, leaving a small space at the top edge of the nori so you can seal up the roll.<br>PRO TIP: Wet your fingers as you spread the sticky sushi rice over the nori.<br>Spreading sushi rice onto nori<br>Spreading sushi rice onto nori | Photo by Meredith3. Add your ingredients toward the center of the rice-covered nori. Don't overpack it. If you're making a roll with the rice on the outside, simply turn the nori over, placing it rice-side down on the rolling mat. Then add your ingredients to the top of the nori.<br>Putting sushi ingredients toward center<br>Putting ingredients toward center | Photo by Meredith4. Gently lift the bottom of the mat up and over the sushi. Press and shape the ingredients into a tube. Roll with pressure so you get a firm roll.<br>Rolling sushi in bamboo mat<br>Rolling sushi in bamboo mat | Photo by Meredith5. Roll until just an inch of nori shows at the top. Seal the edge of the nori with a little cold water. Firm it up by squeezing the mat around the roll until it feels uniformly snug. Be careful not to squeeze so hard that the ingredients are smashed or come oozing out the sides. It's a fine line; with practice you'll get the feel of it.<br>Rolling sushi and dampening edge with water<br>Dampening edge with water | Photo by Meredith6. Slice the sushi roll in half with a sharp knife on a cutting board. Then cut each half into thirds -- so you have 6 pieces of sushi. To get a nice clean cut, wet the knife with water each time you make a slice.<br>Cutting a roll of Sushi<br>Cutting sushi | Photo by Meredith<br>7. Line the slices of sushi up on platters or sushi plates. Enjoy with soy sauce, wasabi paste, and pickled ginger, and a little chopped daikon if you like.</p>
